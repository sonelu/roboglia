class BaseThread():
    """Implements a class that wraps a processing logic that is executed
    in a separate thread with the ability to pause / resume or fully stop
    the task.


    The main processing should be implemented in the `run` method where the
    subclass should make sure that it checks periodically the status
    (`paused` or `stopped`) and behave appropriately. The `run` can
    be flanked by the `setup` and `teardown` methods where subclasses can
    implement logic needed before the main processing is started or finished.

    This becomes very handy for loops that normally prepare the work, then
    run for an indefinite time, and later are closed when the owner signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the thread.

    patience: float
        A duration in seconds that the main thread will wait for the
        background thread to finish setup activities and indicate that it
        is in ``started`` mode.
